- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name isÂ Mihail(@MihailMatyatsko)
- ðŸ‘€  I'm interested in iOS app development. Previously, I was engaged in the repair of cars and computers, the path to programming was a long one.
- ðŸŒ±I'm currently working as a mobile ios app developer and mainly using Swift/Obj-C languages (note: I didn't have any commercial project that was developed on SwiftUI). I have previously studied C++, C# and php (very long time ago).
I will also add that after completing my schooling, I passed the English exam for a B2 + certificate and can write and communicate in English without any problems. Perhaps the lack of communication and experience worsened my level of knowledge, but I hope not significantly. I also know Ukrainian, Russian and quite a bit Polish.
- ðŸ“« If you still decide to contact me, you can do it via email or telegram @FiggyFox. Also I added my Twitter account in GitHub profile.
