- 👋 Hi, I’m @MihailMatyatsko
- 👀  I am interested in iOS application development and development itself. Previously, I was involved in the repair of cars and computers.
- 🌱 I am currently learning Swift, SwiftUI. Previously studied C ++, C #, php. I will rate the level of that knowledge as average. 
I will also add that after school I successfully passed the English exam in B2 + and can write and communicate in it without any problems. 
Perhaps the lack of communication and practice has worsened my level of knowledge, but I hope not significantly.
- 💞️ Now I am already doing an internship at one company, but in case of failure, I don’t know where to go, so I will be open to suggestions.
- 📫 If you still decide to contact me, you can do it via email or telegram @FiggyFox. Also on my profile is my Twitter account.
